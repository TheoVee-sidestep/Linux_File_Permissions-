# Linux_File_Permissions-
The folowing project is a done on a mock company where I updated their file permissions via linux command line.
I include snips of the code where I was inputting bash commands as user "researcher2@5d738fof927b:~/projects$".
I further explain what I was doing and my thinking behind my commands via text.
